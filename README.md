xUnique
=======

**xUnique**, is a pure Python script to regenerate `project.pbxproj`, a.k.a the Xcode project file, and make it unique and same on any machine.
 
As you may know, the [`UUID`](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) generated by Xcode in the file is not unique for the same added file( or other entries like groups,build phases,etc.) on different machines, which makes it a developer's nightmare to merge and resolve conflicts in `project.pbxproj`.

**xUnique** convert all the 96bits `UUID`(24 hex chars) to MD5 hex digest(32 hex chars)

### What it does & How it works
----------------
1. convert `project.pbxproj` to JSON format
2. Iterate all `objects` in JSON and give every UUID an absolute path, and create a new UUID using MD5 hex digest of the path
	* All elements in this json object is actually connected as a tree
	* We give a path attribute to every node of the tree using its unique attribute; this path is the absolute path to the root node, 
	* Apply MD5 hex digest to the path for the node
3. Replace all old UUIDs with the MD5 hex digest and also remove unused UUIDs if any
4. ~~Sort project file using my modified [`sort-Xcode-project-file`](https://github.com/truebit/webkit/commits/master/Tools/Scripts/sort-Xcode-project-file), supports following new features:~~ 
    * ~~sort `PBXFileReference` and `PBXBuildFile` sections~~
    * ~~avoid modified changes in Git/SVN if no change made in the project file~~
4. Sort the project file inlcuding `children` list, `files` list, `PBXFileReference` list and `PBXBuildFile` list using pure Python 
	* see `sort_pbxproj` method in xUnique.py if you wanna know the implementation;
	* It's ported from the [perl script](https://github.com/truebit/webkit/commits/master/Tools/Scripts/sort-Xcode-project-file), I have to admit that Perl is really very good at text processing...
5. All above operations are what this script done for you;)


### How to use
--------------
There are many ways to use this script. I will introduce two types:

##### Xcode "build post-action" (Recommended)
  1. open `Edit Scheme` in Xcode (shortcut: `âŒ˜`+`Shift`+`,`)
  2. choose the sheme you use to run your project
  3. expand `Build`, select `Post-actions`
  4. click symbol `+` on the left bottom corner of the right pane
  5. choose `New Run Script Action`
  6. choose your selected sheme name in `Provide build settings from`
  7. input commands below (assume that `xUnique.py` is under directory of `/project/dir/Scripts`):
  
     ```bash
     python "${PROJECT_DIR}/Scripts/xUnique.py" "${PROJECT_FILE_PATH}/project.pbxproj"
     ```
  8. click `Close` and it's all done.
  9. Next time when you Build or Run the project, xUnique would be triggered after build success. If the build works, you could commit all files.
  10. Demo gif animation is [here](#add-xunique-to-xcode-post-action)
     
##### Git hook
  1. Put **xUnique.py** file in your project repository somewhere and add it as track file via `git add path/to/xUnique.py`, so all members could use the same script
  2. create a git hook like `{ echo '#!/bin/sh'; echo 'python2 path/to/xUnique.py path/to/MyProject.xcodeproj'; } > .git/hooks/pre-commit`
  3. Add permission `chmod 755 .git/hooks/pre-commit` 
  4. xUnique will be triggered when you trying to commit:
  	* Using option `-c` in command would fail the commit operation if project file is modified. Then you can add the modified project file and commit all the files again.
  	* Option `-c` is not activated by default. The commit operation will proceed successfully even if the project file is modified by xUnique. So do not push the commit unless you add the modified project file again and do another commit.

#### Supported argument options
* `-v`: print verbose output, and generate `debug_result.json` file for debug.
* `-u`: uniquify project file, that is, replace UUID to MD5 digest.
* `-s`: sort project file inlcuding `children` list, `files` list. Supports both original and uniquified project file. 
* `-p`: sort `PBXFileReference` and `PBXBuildFile` sections in project file ordered by file names. v3.1.0 and before are enabled in `-s` option and cannot be turned off. After v3.1.0, it's off by default and add this option to turn on like before as I found that these two types are sorted by Xcode and ordered by MD5 values automatically.
* `-c`: When project file was modified, xUnique quit with non-zero status. Without this option, the status code would be zero if so. This option is usually used in Git hook to submit xUnique result combined with your original new commit.
* if neither `-u` nor `-s` exists, `-u -s` will be appended to existing option list.

    
#### Git merge strategy
* There are still conflicts after using xUnique. That's because the incorrect merge strategy used by Git against project file.
* use [Git Attributes](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes) to make git know how to deal with `project.pbxproj`:
* create a file named `.gitattributes` in git repo root directory (a.k.a the same level with `.git` directory) if it does not exist
* add line `*.pbxproj text -crlf -diff -merge=union` in the file
* save file and add this file to git repo
      

### Examples
------------
* [APNS Pusher](https://github.com/blommegard/APNS-Pusher) is a Xcode project which contains a subproject named "Fragaria" as git submodule. Use _xUnique_ to convert it. You can clone [my forked repo](https://github.com/truebit/APNS-Pusher) and try to open and build it in Xcode. You will find that `xUnique` does not affect the project at all.

### NOTICE
----------
* All project members must add the build post-action or git hook. Thus the project file would be consistent in the repository.
* Tested supported `isa` types:
    * `PBXProject`
    * `XCConfigurationList`
    * `PBXNativeTarget`
    * `PBXTargetDependency`
    * `PBXContainerItemProxy`
    * `XCBuildConfiguration`
    * `PBXSourcesBuildPhase`
    * `PBXFrameworksBuildPhase`
    * `PBXResourcesBuildPhase`
    * `PBXFrameworksBuildPhase`
    * `PBXCopyFilesBuildPhase`
    * `PBXBuildFile`
    * `PBXReferenceProxy`
    * `PBXFileReference`
    * `PBXGroup`
    * `PBXVariantGroup`

-----------------
* I only tested on one single project and one project with a subproject, so maybe there should be more unconsidered conditions.
